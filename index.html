                <p><strong>Quran:</strong> "Say, 'I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your god is one God.'" (Quran 18:110)</p>
                <p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> The Prophet Muhammad and his companions were human and subject to human limitations.</p>
                <p><strong>Hadith:</strong> The Prophet acknowledged his own human limitations and made mistakes. (Sahih Bukhari 6122)</p>
                <p><strong>Premise 3:</strong> Sunni Islam recognizes the Prophet as the only infallible figure in Islam, with all others subject to error.</p>

            <h2>Emphasizing Dawah Over Debate</h2>
            <p>
                Islam is a religion of peace, understanding, and respectful dialogue. While debates can be a part of academic and theological discussions, the primary focus should always be on giving dawah — inviting others to understand and embrace the beauty of Islam with kindness and wisdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Quran teaches us the importance of inviting others to Islam in a compassionate and wise manner. Here are some verses that highlight this approach:
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                "Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best." (Quran 16:125)
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                "And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, 'Indeed, I am of the Muslims.'" (Quran 41:33)
            </p>
            <p>
                It is through sincere dawah, rather than contentious debates, that we can truly convey the message of Islam and foster understanding and unity.
